            <h3><a name="about">About the Baseline Atlas</a></h3>

            <p>The Baseline Atlas represents information about which gene
            products are present (and at what abundance) in which "normal" condition (e.g.,
            tissue, cell type). The Baseline Atlas consists of
            highly curated RNA&ndash;seq experiments from <a
                href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">ArrayExpress</a>, such as: </p>

            <p>The above experiments have been re&ndash;analyzed using an in&ndash;house RNA&ndash;seq
            processing pipeline. The resulting data matrix stores gene
            expression profiles across the analyzed experimental variables as a set of
            normalized expression levels (<a
                class="externallink"
                title="FPKMs"
                href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n5/full/nbt.1621.html">FPKMs</a>).
            You can search the data by a combination of genes attributes, experimental
                variables, and a minimum FPKM cutoff. See below for more details on searching.</p>




            <h3><a name="at-a-glance">Baseline Atlas at&ndash;a&ndash;glance</a></h3>

            <p><a href="../resources/images/help/baseline-atlas-overview.pdf"><img alt="Baseline Atlas Experiment View 'At a Glance'" src="../resources/images/help/exptPageHelp.png" align="bottom" /></a></p>




            <h3><a name="filtering">Filtering Baseline Atlas data</a></h3>

            <p><img alt="filtering" src="../resources/images/help/filtering.png" align="bottom" /></p>
            <p>Some experiments have <b>more than one</b> experimental variable type. For example, in experiment
            <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEOD-26284">E-GEOD-26284</a>,
            three different <b>types of RNA</b> were extracted from <b>six cellular components</b> from <b>23
            human cell lines</b>. Results for these experiments are limited to a certain
            combination of variables, e.g. showing expression of <b>total RNA</b> in the
            <b>whole cell</b>. To limit the search results differently, use the "Change
            filters" menu. In a 3&ndash;factor experiment, you can choose one value from any two
            of the factors, and then search among the values for the remaining factor.
            E.g., if you choose to limit to <b>poly(A) RNA</b> extracted from the
            <b>cytosol</b>, you can then search among the <b>cell lines</b> for which this
            data is available.</p>




            <h3><a name="searching">Searching Baseline Atlas</a></h3>


            <h4><a name="minExprLevel">Specifying the minimum expression level</a></h4>

            <p>You can specify a minimum expression level to act as a <b>cutoff</b>, and only genes expressed <b>above</b> this level are displayed. This is to aid distinction between "background noise" and "real" gene expression. Our default FPKM cutoff is 0.5. To change it, enter a new value into the "Expression level cutoff" input box, or drag the slider until the "Expression level cutoff" input box shows your desired cutoff value. A histogram showing the number of genes expressed above a range of cutoffs is also available. This lets you see how many genes you are excluding by selecting a given cutoff. If you see that you're excluding a lot of genes, you may wish to <b>decrease</b> the cutoff. Clicking on the <img alt="Histogram enable/disable button" src="../resources/images/help/histogram_btn.png" align="bottom" /> button toggles display of the histogram.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If you have not selected any experimental variables, the histogram shows the number of genes expressed in <b>any</b> experimental variable for each of the shown cutoffs.</li>
                <li>If you have selected <b>at least one</b> factor value, the histogram shows the number of genes expressed in <b>at least one of the selected factor values</b>, for each of the shown cutoffs.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3><a name="geneSearch">Searching with genes</a></h3>

            <p>You can search with <a class="externallink" href="http://ensembl.org">Ensembl</a> gene symbols (e.g. SAA4), identifiers (e.g. ENSG00000148965) or <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Glossary">biotypes</a> (e.g. protein_coding), <a href="http://www.uniprot.org">UniProt</a> accessions (e.g. P35542), <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO</a> ("phosphoglycerate kinase activity") or <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">InterPro</a> terms (e.g. phosphatase). A <b>space&ndash;separated</b> list of gene attributes will bring back genes that match <b>at least one</b> of the attributes in the query. Put multi-word query terms in quotes e.g. "transcription factor binding".</p>

            <p>If the "Exact match" box is checked, only genes with annotations that fully match your query will be returned. For example, to find the expression of the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000198668">calmodulin 1</a> gene, check the "Exact match" box, type "CALM1" and click "Search". If the box is not checked, genes with annotations that contain words that fully match your query will be returned. For example, to find expressions for genes with "calmodulin" in their annotations (e.g. "calmodulin binding", "calmodulin regulated", &hellip;), uncheck the "Exact match" box, type "calmodulin" and click search.</p>

            <p>If you search with a single gene you have the option of seeing the variation of expression among the biological replicates for each tissue (or other condition) in the experiment, for this gene. Select the "Display variation" to display a plot showing the minimum, maximum, median, and upper and lower quartiles for each set of biological replicates. Mouseover the box plots to see the actual values.</p>

            <p><img alt="Gene expression variation in biological replicates" src="../resources/images/help/baselineBoxplots.png" align="bottom" /></p>

            <h5>Similar expression</h5>

            <p>Another option available for single-gene queries is to view a list of genes that show a similar expression pattern across the tested conditions. Click the button "Add similary expressed genes" below the heatmap to display similar genes in the same heatmap and adjust the number of presented genes using the slider at the bottom. The order of the additional genes is determined by the degree of similarity, with the most similar expression pattern at the top.</p>

            <p><img alt="Show similarly expressed genes" src="../resources/images/help/similar_expression.png" align="bottom" /></p>

            <h5>Gene sets</h5>

            <p>If you search for a term that matches multiple genes, e.g. a <a href="http://www.reactome.org/">Reactome</a> pathway ID such as "R-HSA-5693565", the heatmap will show one row per gene matching your term:</p>

            <p><img alt="Gene set query before" src="../resources/images/help/geneSet_before.png" align="bottom" /></p>

            <p>You can summarize the results for each "gene set" term by clicking "show by gene set":</p>

            <p><img alt="Gene set query after" src="../resources/images/help/geneSet_after.png" align="bottom" /></p>

            <p>Click "show individual genes" to return to the original view.</p>


            <h3><a name="efvSearch">Searching with experimental variables</a></h3>

            <p>Use the experimental variable input box to search for e.g. <i>organism part</i> or <i>cell line</i> values, or leave it blank to search in all. You can search:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>within a <b>single&ndash;factor</b> experiment, e.g. <a href="/experiments/E-MTAB-513" title="E-MTAB-513">Illumina Body Map</a><a title="E-MTAB-513" href="/experiments/E-MTAB-513">,</a> or</li>
                <li>within a pre&ndash;selected subset of a <b>multi&ndash;factorial</b> experiment, e.g. <a href="/experiments/E-GEOD-26284" rel="nofollow" title="E-GEOD-26284">RNA&ndash;seq of long coding and long non coding RNAs from ENCODE cell lines</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>When you click on the experiment factor value input box, a dropdown menu appears, containing the list of all factor values available for selection:</p>
            <p><img alt="Factor values dropdown" src="../resources/images/help/factor_values_dropdown.png" align="bottom" /></p>
            <p>Select one or more factor values to search with, or start typing to see suggestions. To see all factor values in an experiment, click the <img alt="Experiment Design" src="../resources/images/help/expDes_btn.png" align="bottom" /> button.</p>




            <h5><i>Specific</i> vs. <i>non&ndash;specific</i> search</h5>

            <p>The default Baseline Atlas search reports genes with more "specific" expression (with the <i>Specific</i> option selected by default). What we mean by this is outlined below.</p>

            <h6>If the query contains no factor values&hellip;</h6>

            <p>If the query contains <b>no experimental variables</b>, the <i>Specific</i> search will report genes expressed in just <b>one</b> experimental variable, then genes expressed in just <b>two</b> factor values, then three and so on, reporting any genes expressed in all the available factor values at the end of the list of results. Within each group of genes expressed in N factor values only, genes are sorted by the highest average FPKM across the N factor values in which they are expressed.</p>

            <h6>If the query contains at least one factor value&hellip;</h6>
            <p>If the query contains <b>at least one</b> experimental variable, the <i>Specific</i> search will promote genes with <b>higher average FPKM</b> in the <b>queried</b> factor value(s), and at the same time penalize genes with higher FPKMs in the <b>non&ndash;queried</b> factor values. This is done using the "fold difference" between the query and non-query FPKMs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fold difference is calculated by dividing the <b>average FPKM</b> of the queried factor values by the <b>highest FPKM</b> of the non-query factor values.</li>
                <li>If <b>none</b> of the non-query FPKMs are above the selected expression level cutoff, the average of the query FPKMs is divided by the cutoff instead.</li>
                <li>If <b>none</b> of the non-query FPKMs are above the cutoff and the cutoff is <b>zero</b>, 0.09 is used as the denominator instead of the cutoff.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>Genes with the <b>greatest fold difference</b> in expression between query and non&ndash;query factor values will be pushed towards the top of the list. Genes that have higher expression in non-query factor values than in the query factor values are not shown.</p>

                <h6><i>Non&ndash;specific</i> search</h6>
              <p>If the <i>Specific</i> option is not selected, the Baseline Atlas search will <b>ignore</b> specificity of expression when ordering the results. In particular:</p>

              <ul>
                  <li>If the query contains <b>no experimental variables</b>, genes with the highest expression across <b>all</b> factor values will be reported first.</li>
                  <li>If the query contains <b>at least one</b> experimental variable, genes with higher FPKM across the <b>selected</b> factor values are reported first. Expression levels across the non&ndash;selected factor values are <b>ignored</b> in the ordering of results.</li>
              </ul>




            <h3><a name="heatmap">Heatmap results display</a></h3>

            <p>Results for your query are shown in a heatmap table. The heatmap rows and columns are labelled with gene symbols and experimental variables, respectively. The heatmap shows expressions by <b>colour intensity</b>, according to the gradient bar,<img alt="heatmap colour gradient" src="../resources/images/help/gradient.png" align="bottom" />, displayed above the heatmap. Greater colour intensity means higher relative gene expression. To see the exact FPKM for all genes, click on the <img alt="Display levels" src="../resources/images/help/display_levels.png" align="bottom" /> button. This also reveals minimum and maximum FPKMs on each side of the gradient bar. The gradient shows intensities corresponding to expression levels for the <b>top 50</b> genes currently displayed (rather than all FPKM values for all genes returned by the query).</p>

            <p>When displayed factor values are organism parts, mousing over each heatmap column highlights the corresponding tissue in the anatomogram on the left (if available). If the selected organism part is gender&ndash;specifc, and anatomogram is available for each gender, you can switch between them by clicking the <img alt="Gender selection button" src="../resources/images/help/gender_sel.png" align="bottom" /> button.</p>

            <p>If you mouse-over a gene name in the heatmap, synonyms, <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology</a> terms, and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">Interpro</a> terms are displayed:</p>

            <img alt="gene mouseover popup" src="../resources/images/help/geneMouseover.png" align="bottom" />

            <p>Any terms that match your search query term(s) are highlighted in yellow here. Click the gene name to see more information about that gene, including other Expression Atlas experiments in which it was found.</p>
