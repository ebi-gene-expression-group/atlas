        <h3>How to search in Single Cell Expression Atlas</h3>
        <p>
            Here you can use the <b>Gene search box</b> to search whether a gene comprises part of a cell type
            expression profile. You may search its gene ID via its gene symbol or name (e.g. <i>APOA2</i>). A
            dropdown box will appear showing related gene symbols and species-specific results to choose from.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also specify which species (e.g. <i>Mus musculus</i>) you are interested in. Use the <b>Species
            drop down</b> to specify your organism of interest. Once your selection is made, searching for a gene ID
            will restrict suggestions to the specified species.
        </p>

        <h3> Search Results</h3>
        <p>
            Once you have selected the gene symbol of interest click <b>Search</b> and this will load a new page of
            all experiments where your selected gene is expressed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Search results can be filtered using the selection criteria along the left hand side of the search results page.
            Selecting a filter criteria will remove all non-applicable experiments from the search results. For example: selecting
            <b>Species: Homo sapiens</b> will show only human experiments, similar to searching only on the human specific gene symbol in
            the Home page Search bar. Additionally, you can select experiments where a gene is expressed only in a particular <b>Organism part</b>
            or <b>Inferred cell type</b> by selecting these from the relevant drop-down menus.

            This is a list of the latest five experiments added to the Single Cell Expression Atlas, their title and
            upload date. You can click on the <b>Results</b> link or the experiment title to jump directly to the

        <h3>Experiment page</h3>
        <p>
            Each experiment in Single Cell Expression Atlas has its own <b>experiment page</b>, just click on the title
            of any experiment to view it. At the top of the results page you will see the title of the experiment, the
            type of experiment and species information.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below the experiment information you will find a list of any associated publication(s).

            The Experiment page is comprised of four sections:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Results: this is where you can visualise the t-SNE plot and gene expression for the data</li>
            <li>Experiment Design: this is where you can find the simplified sample metadata for the experiment</li>
            <li>Supplementary Information: here you can find the data analysis pipelines and corresponding documentation</li>
            <li>Downloads: links to the raw data files; analysis results and sample metadata files</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Results tab</h4>
        <p>
            Here you can view the results of the data analysis. The t-SNE plot displays subpopulations within the data
            and on the left and gene expression variation at single-cell resolution on the right. Each plot can be
            saved by clicking on the drop down menu symbol at the top right-hand side of the plot.

        <h5>t-SNE plot with clusters</h5>
        <p>
            <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">t-SNE plots</a> are a useful way of visualising highly complex
            data in a 2D space. Although the size and distance between clusters is not very informative, manipulating
            the t-SNE perplexity value allows you to re-display the data in different ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            The number of clusters (<i>k</i> value) shows the output of the
            <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/single-cell-consensus-clustering-sc3">Single-cell Consensus
                Clustering analysis (SC3 algorithm)</a>. The SC3 algorithm groups cell clusters based on similar expression
            profiles. This also colours the data to allow easier visualisation of different sub-populations within a
            dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>New Feature (01.08.2018):</b> It is now possible to colour the clusters by metadata! The colour legend for each
            group of cells is displayed along the bottom of the t-sne plot.

            The metadata used to colour the clusters is derived from different experimental groups described by the authors. This is displayed in the
            <b>Experiment Design</b> tab along the top of the results page.

        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="resources/images/help/tsne_colour_by_metadata.png" alt="t-SNE plot">
        </p>

        <p>
            You can hover over a single data point (cell) and a tool-tip will pop up. This displays the <b>single cell
            identifier</b> (a unique reference for that cell) and the <b>cluster ID</b> (which other cells share
            similar gene expression profiles). Additional information can include <b>cell type</b>: submitted cell type
            prior to sequencing analysis and/or the <b>inferred cell type</b>: cell type inferred by sequencing
            analysis based on gene expression profile.
        </p>

        <p>
            The default values for perplexity and number of clusters are automatically generated by the analysis
            pipelines. They aim to provide a general idea of the data as well as the expected number of clusters.
        </p>

        <p>
            The range of perplexity and <i>k</i> values are produced by the pipeline. However, there is a different
            logic for the selected default values. Perplexity value is chosen somewhat randomly, to be in the middle of
            the range. For the <i>k</i> value, we have a multi-step process: it will preferably be the expected
            clusters value determined by a member of the curation team. If not, it will be the “optimal” value as
            chosen by the SC3 algorithm output. If that is also not available, then it will just be the first value in
            the list.
        </p>

        <h5>t-SNE plot with gene expression</h5>
        <p>
            Use the <b>Gene search box</b> to search whether a gene comprises part of a cells' expression profile.
        </p>

        <p>
            Expression levels are displayed as TPM (transcripts per million) and broken down in five different,
            logarithmic colour ranges:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grey spot: expression level is below cutoff (0.1 TPM) or undetected</li>
            <li>Light blue spot: expression level is low (between 0.1 to 10 TPM)</li>
            <li>Medium blue spot: expression level is medium (between 11 to 1000 TPM)</li>
            <li>Dark blue spot: expression level is high (more than 1000 TPM)</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Experiment Design tab</h4>
        <p>
            This tab displays the <b>Experiment design file</b> – a simplified table of the the sample metadata and
            experimental variables. <b>Sample characteristics</b> are generally intrinsic metadata required to
            understand each sample. <b>Experimental variables</b> are usually one or several sample characteristics
            that describe the experiment groups defined by the study aim. You can browse by row (each row is a single
            cell). You can also sort each column by clicking on the header row of your attribute of interest. Traverse
            the data by indicating the number of rows to view at the bottom and by clicking on the <b>Previous</b> and
            <b>Next</b> buttons.
