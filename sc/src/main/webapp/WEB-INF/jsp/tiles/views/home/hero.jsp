        <p>
            The cell is a natural unit of biology, whose type and state can vary according to external influences or to
            internal processes. In multicellular organisms, all cells are derived from a single zygote which, through
            regulated programmes of proliferation and differentiation, generates all of the diverse cell types that
            populate the organism. Dysregulation of these programmes in single ‘renegade’ cells can lead to diseases
            such as cancers, neurological disorders and developmental disorders.
