Comment[Submitted Name]	Sorghum nitrogen stress tolerance						
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Comparison of transcriptomes between N-stress tolerant and sensitive genotypes						
Experiment Description	Sorghum is an important cereal crop, which requires large quantities of nitrogen fertilizer for achieving commercial yields. Identification of the genes responsible for low-N tolerance in sorghum will facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms of low-N tolerance, and also facilitate the genetic improvement of sorghum through marker-assisted selection or gene transformation. In this study we compared the transcriptomes of root tissues from seven sorghum genotypes having different genetic backgrounds with contrasting low-N tolerance by the RNAseq deep sequencing data. Several genes were found which are common differentially expressed genes between four low-N tolerant sorghum genotypes (San Chi San, China17, KS78 and high-NUE bulk) and three sensitive genotypes (CK60, BTx623 and low-NUE bulk).
