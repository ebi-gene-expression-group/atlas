Investigation Title	Reanalysis of Pandey lab's draft of the human proteome	
Experiment Description	The availability of human genome sequence has transformed biomedical research over the past decade. However, an equivalent map for the human proteome with direct measurements of proteins and peptides was lacking.  To this end, Akhilesh Pandey's lab reported a draft map of the human proteome based on high resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology, which included an in-depth proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples including 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary hematopoietic cells ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13302 ).  The profiling resulted in identification of proteins encoded by greater than 17,000 genes accounting for ~84% of the total annotated protein-coding genes in humans. This large human proteome catalog (available as an interactive web-based resource at http://www.humanproteomemap.org) complements available human genome and transcriptome data to accelerate biomedical research in health and disease.  Pandey's lab and collaborators request that those considering use of this primary dataset for commercial purposes contact pandey@jhmi.edu.  The full details of this study can be found in the PRIDE database: www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000561/.  This ArrayExpress entry represents a top level summary of the metadata only which formed the basis of the reanalysis performed by Joyti Choudhary's team ( jc4@sanger.ac.uk ), results of which are presented in the Expression Atlas at EMBL-EBI :  http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-PROT-1.

Protocol Description	17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues, and 6 hematopoietic cell types were lysed in lysis buffer containing 4% SDS, 100mM DTT and 100 mM Tris pH7.5, homogenized, sonicated, heated for 10-15 min at 750C cooled and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The protein concentration of the cleared lysate was estimated using BCA assay and equal amounts from three donors were pooled for further fractionation. Proteins from SDS lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion was carried out using trypsin. The peptides were extracted, vacuum dried and stored at -80�C until further analysis. 400 �g proteins were subjected to in-solution trypsin digestion following reduction and alkylation with DTT and IAA respectively. The peptide digest were then desalted using Sep-Pak C18 columns (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA), lyophilized and fractionated using high pH reverse phase chromatography using XBridge C18, 5 �m 250 x 4.6 mm column (Waters, Milford, MA). 96 fractions were collected which were then concatenated to 24 fractions, vacuum dried and stored at -80 until further LC-MS analysis.	Mass spectrometry raw data from the draft map of the human proteome (1) was downloaded from the PRIDE (2) repository (PXD000561), comprising 85 experimental samples from 30 human adult and fetal tissues. Raw data was converted to mzML format and was processed in an OpenMS workflow (3). Spectra were searched using Mascot (4, v2.5) and MS-GF+ (5, v10089) against a combined FASTA database containing: GENCODE (6, v20) coding sequences, UniProt (7) human proteome sequences (May 2014), and a set of contaminant sequences. This database was concatenated with an equal number of shuffled decoy sequences. Results from both search engines were processed using MascotPercolator (8, 9, v2.13) and Percolator (10, v2.08) respectively. All database searches were performed with a precursor tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment tolerance of 0.02 Da. Up to three missed cleavages were allowed. The fixed modification carbamidomethyl (+57.0214) was specified for all cysteine residues. In addition, the following variable modifications were used in the searches: N-terminal acetylation (+42.01056), N-terminal carbamidomethyl (+57.0214), deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues (+0.984), oxidation of methionine (+15.9949), and N-terminal conversion of glutamine and glutamic acid to pyro-glutamine (-17.0265, -18.0106). Percolated results were parsed, merged and filtered so that every peptide spectrum match (PSM) had the same identification in both search engines. The worst posterior error probability (PEP) was retained in each case. The PSMs were then filtered to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR), a maximum PEP of 0.05, and a minimum peptide length of 7 amino acids. PSMs matching contaminant or decoy sequences were also removed. GENCODE CDS and UniProt accessions were mapped to Ensembl gene identifiers, and these genes were clustered to remove entries only matching a subset of peptides from another gene. Label free quantification for each mapped Ensembl gene was conducted in each individual tissue. This was calculated as the summed precursor intensities of the most intense three unique peptides in each gene cluster, these were then converted into within sample abundances by dividing by the total summed quantification of all proteins in each sample. These abundance values were then normalised using the ten genes displaying the lowest co-efficient of variation across all tissues, with the median value being taken across replicates.
