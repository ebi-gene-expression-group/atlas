Experiment Description	Stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici; Pst) and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici; Bgt) are important diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Similar mechanisms and gene transcripts are assumed to be involved in the host defense response because both pathogens are biotrophic fungi. The main objective of our study was to identify co-regulated mRNAs that show a change in expression pattern after inoculation with Pst or Bgt, and to identify mRNAs specific to the fungal stress response. In the present study, cDNA libraries were constructed from leaves inoculated with Pst or Bgt at 0, 1, 2 and 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) with three biological replicates, and then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq™ 2000 platform. Note: Samples in SRA were assigned the same sample accession. This is incorrect as there are different samples, hence “Source Name” was replaced with new values. Comment[ENA_SAMPLE] contains the original SRA sample accessions.
