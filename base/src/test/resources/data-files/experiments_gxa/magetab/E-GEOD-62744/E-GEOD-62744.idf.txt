Investigation Title	Transcriptome analysis of 5 red Italian grapevine varieties during berry development		
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome analysis of 5 red Italian grapevine varieties during berry development		
Experiment Description	We report the berry pericarp transcriptomic profiles of 5 red Vitis vinifera varieties: Sangiovese, Barbera, Negro amaro, Refosco and Primitivo at 4 growth stages: pea-sized berries (Bbch 75) at almost 20 days after flowering, berries beginning to touch (Bbch77) just prior véraison, the softening of the berries (Bbch 85) at the end of véraison and berries ripe for harvest (Bbch 89) mRNA profiles of 5 red grapevine varieties at 4 growth stages were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 1000.

Protocol Name	P-GSE62744-3	P-GSE62744-2	P-GSE62744-1
Protocol Description	Illumina Casava1.8 software used for basecalling. Sequenced reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence Sequenced reads were aligned onto Vitis vinifera reference genome PN40024 (12x), using the program TopHat v2.0.6, with default parameters. Mapped reads were used to reconstruct the transcripts using the program Cufflinks v2.0.2 and the V1 version of the 12x draft annotation of the grapevine genome. Reconstructed transcripts were merged into a single non-redundant list of 29287 transcripts, using the program Cuffmerge, from the Cufflinks package. Using this novel list of transcripts, the normalized mean expression of each transcript was calculated in FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of Mapped reads) for each triplicate using the geometric normalization method. Genome_build: Vitis vinifera reference genome PN40024 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: tab-delimited text file including mean FPKM values of the biological triplicate for each variety at each stage	Total RNA was extracted from approximately 400 mg of berry pericarp tissue (entire berries without seeds) ground in liquid nitrogen, using the Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich) with some modifications. The sixty non-directional cDNA libraries were prepared from 2,5 �g of total RNA using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample preparation protocol RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols	Grape berries were collected from five red-skin-coloured Vitis vinifera cultivars, all cultivated in the same experimental vineyard (Conegliano, Veneto region, Italy), during the 2011 season.
