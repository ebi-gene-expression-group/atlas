Comment[Submitted Name]	RNA-seq of coding RNA of 19 human tissues from fetuses with congenital defects (NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium)					
Experiment Description	The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium aims to produce a public resource of epigenomic maps for stem cells and primary ex vivo tissues selected to represent the normal counterparts of tissues and organ systems frequently involved in human disease. This data set was submitted by University of Washington as part of GSE18927 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE18927 ) / SRP001371 at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and Sequence Read Archive respectively.  The ArrayExpress record here contains only RNA-seq meta-data for the 53 human fetal samples covering 19 different tissues/organs from 23 fetuses.  You can find out more about WashU's contribution to this project here: http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/index.html.  The full set of NIH Epigenome Project data (not limited to RNA-seq) can be found here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/roadmap/epigenomics
