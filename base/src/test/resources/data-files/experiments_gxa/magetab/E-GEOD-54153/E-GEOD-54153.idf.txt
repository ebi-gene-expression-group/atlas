Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of stem differentiating xylem from Populus trichocarpa transgenics overexpressing PtrMIR397a  															
Experiment Description	Laccases were proposed to catalyze the oxidative polymerization of monolignols. We identified 49 laccase gene models in Populus trichocarpa, of which 29 were predicted to be targets of ptr-miR397a. We overexpressed Ptr-MIR397a in transgenic P. trichocarpa. In each of all 9 transgenic lines tested, 17 PtrLACs were down-regulated as analyzed by RNA-seq. Transgenic lines with severe reduction in the expression of these laccase genes resulted in an approximately 40% decrease in the total laccase activity. Overexpression of Ptr-MIR397a in these transgenic lines also reduced lignin content, whereas levels of all monolignol biosynthetic gene transcripts remained unchanged. A hierarchical genetic regulatory network (GRN) built by a bottom-up Graphic Gaussian Model algorithm provides additional support for a role of ptr-miR397a as a negative regulator of laccases for lignin biosynthesis. Full transcriptome based differential gene expression in the overexpressed transgenics and protein domain analyses implicate previously unidentified transcription factors and their targets in an extended hierarchical GRN including ptr-miR397a and laccases that coregulate lignin biosynthesis in wood formation. Ptr-miR397a, laccases and other regulatory components of this network may provide additional strategies for genetic manipulation of lignin content. Total twelve trees were used. Those include nine individual transgenic trees for overexpressing Ptr-miR397a, as nine biological replicates, and three wild-type trees.
