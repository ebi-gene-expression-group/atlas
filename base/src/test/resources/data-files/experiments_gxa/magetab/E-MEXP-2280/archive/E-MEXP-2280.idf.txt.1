Experiment Description	We have constructed genome wide expression profiles from snap frozen post-mortem tissue from the medial temporal lobe of patients with four neurodegenerative disorders (5 AD, 5 PSP, 5 PiD and 5 FTD patients) and 5 control subjects. All patients were matched for age, gender, ApoE-epsilon and MAPT (tau) haplotype. From all groups a total of 790 probes were shown to be differently expressed when compared to control individuals. The results from these experiments were then used to investigate the correlations between clinical, pathological and molecular findings. From the 790 identified probes we extracted a gene set of 166 probes whose expression could discriminate between these disorders and normal ageing. This gene set can be further developed into an accurate microarray-based classification test. Furthermore, from this dataset we extracted a disease specific set of genes and identified two aging related transcription factors (FOXO1A and FOXO3A) as possible drug targets related to neurodegenerative disease.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-4951	P-MTAB-4952		
Protocol Description	RNA was isolated from 100 - 200 mg snap frozen brain material that had been stored at -80 ∞C. RNA was isolated in groups of four samples, to prevent degradation during the isolation procedure, using 2-4 ml RNA-Bee (Iso-Tex diagnostics Inc, Friendswood, Texas, USA) and purified using the RNeasy RNA cleanup kit (QIAGEN Benelux B.V., Venlo, The Netherlands) according to manufacturerís protocol. It was then quantified using a spectrophotometer and quality was assessed using an Agilent 6000 Nano bioanalyser chip (Agilent Technologies Netherlands B.V., Amstelveen, The Netherlands). RNA samples were only included when the ratio between 28s and 18s rRNA was higher than 0.5 and contributed to more than 15% of total mRNA. Ten µg of total RNA was transcribed into cDNA and subsequently into biotin labelled complement RNA (cRNA) using the Affymetrix one cycle target labelling kit (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, California, USA).<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	All microarray data was normalised using GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) 3.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, California, USA). Only marginal (0.06<p<0.04) and present (p<0.04) probe sets, that were present in four of the five initial samples were used for subsequent permutation analysis using the statistical package Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) in R (http://www.r-project.org).<br><br><br><br>For the cluster analysis (to correct for inter-experimental error between original and control datasets) all 790 probes obtained in the stringent analysis were standardised between the two experiments by dividing expression values of the 790 genes from the original dataset and the new dataset by the average expression ratio of the two datasets per probe in Microsoft excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond WA, USA). Since the second set of samples did not include controls, standardisation was only done using patient samples from the first dataset. Next, expression of independent genes (Expn) was transformed to fit between 1 and 0 using the minimal (Expmin) and maximal expression (Expmax) according to following formula: (Expn-Expmin/(Expmax-Expmin)), and hierarchical cluster analysis was done using Cluster3. <br><br>
