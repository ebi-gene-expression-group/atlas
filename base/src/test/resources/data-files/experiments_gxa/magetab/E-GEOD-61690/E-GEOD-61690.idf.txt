Investigation Title	Transcriptional changes in dormant and non_dormant potato meristems		
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptional changes in dormant and non_dormant potato meristems		
Experiment Description	RNA was sequenced from meristems excised from dormant and non-dormant potato tubers harvested from four different harvest years. Expression based on mapped RNA-sequences was accomplished from excised meristems from fall harvested (dormant tubers) and the same harvested tubers were stored under standard commercial conditions until sprouting was present (non-dormant). The experiment was replicated for four different harvest years.

Protocol Name	P-GSE61690-1	P-GSE61690-3	P-GSE61690-2
Protocol Description	Dormant tubers mersitems were harvested approximately two weeks after harvest. Nondormant tubers mmeristesm were harvested from tubers stored at 4 C until peeping.	Meristems were excised with a micro curette, frozen in liquid N2. RNA was isolated using an Ambion RNA extraction kit. RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols	Plants were field grown in the Red River Valley in North Dakota. Tubers were mechanically harvested.
