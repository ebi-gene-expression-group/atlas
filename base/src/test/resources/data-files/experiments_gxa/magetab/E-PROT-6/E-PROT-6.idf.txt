Experiment Description	The proteomic landscapes of 50 colorectal cancer cell lines were characterized with isobaric labelling and tribrid mass spectrometry analysis. Protein cell extracts were digested with trypsin and the resultant peptides were labelled with the TMT10plex reagents. The peptide mixtures were fractionated with HPLC and the collected fractions were subjected to LC-MS analysis on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer using the multi-notch MS3 approach.

Protocol Description	The PBS washed cell pellets containing 3x106 cells were dissolved in 150 ul 0.1 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), 0.1% SDS with pulsed probe sonication (EpiShear, power 40%) on ice for 20 sec and direct boiling at 95 C in a preheated heat block for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured with Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Aliquots containing 100 ug of total protein were prepared for trypsin digestion. Cysteine disulfide bonds were reduced with a final concentration of 5 mM tris-2-carboxymethyl phosphine (TCEP) followed by 1 h incubation in heating block at 60 C. Cysteine residues were blocked with a final concentration of 10 mM freshly prepared Iodoacetamide (IAA) solution and 30 min incubation at room temperature in dark. Trypsin (Pierce, MS grade) was added at mass ratio 1:30 for overnight digestion. The resultant peptides were diluted up to 100 ul with 0.1 M TEAB buffer. A 41 ul volume of anhydrous acetonitrile was added to each TMT 10-plex reagent (Thermo Scientific) vial and after vortex mixing the content of each TMT vial was transferred to each sample tube. The labeling reaction was quenched after 1 hour by the addition of 8 ul 5% hydroxylamine. Samples were combined and the mixture was dried with speedvac concentrator and stored at -20 C until the high-pH Reverse Phase (RP) fractionation. High pH Reverse Phase (RP) peptide fractionation was performed with the Waters, XBridge C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 3.5 um, 120 A) on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system equipped with autosampler. Mobile phase (A) was composed of 0.1% ammonium hydroxide and mobile phase (B) was composed of 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% ammonium hydroxide. The TMT labelled peptide mixture was reconstituted in 100 ul mobile phase (A), centrifuged and injected for fractionation. The multi-step gradient elution method at 0.2 ml/min was as follows: for 5 minutes isocratic at 5% (B), for 35 min gradient to 35% (B), for 5 min gradient to 80% (B), isocratic for 5 minutes and re-equilibration to 5% (B). LC-MS analysis was performed on the Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system coupled with the Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Each peptide fraction was reconstituted in 40 ul 0.1% formic acid and a volume of 7 ul was loaded to the Acclaim PepMap 100, 100 um x 2 cm C18, 5 um, 100A trapping column with the ulPickUp mode at 10 ul/min flow rate. The sample was then subjected to a multi-step gradient elution on the Acclaim PepMap  RSLC (75 um x 50 cm, 2 um, 100A) C18 capillary column (Dionex) retrofitted to an electrospray emitter (New Objective, FS360-20-10-D-20) at 45 C. Mobile phase (A) was composed of 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase (B) was composed of 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The gradient separation method at flow rate 300 nl/min was as follows: for 95 min gradient to 42% B, for 5 min up to 95% B, for 8 min isocratic at 95% B, re-equilibration to 5% B in 2 min, for 10 min isocratic at 5% B. Precursors were selected with mass resolution of 120k, AGC  3x105 and IT 100 ms in the top speed mode within 3 sec and were isolated for CID fragmentation with quadrupole isolation width 0.7 Th. Collision energy was set at 35% with AGC 1x104 and IT 35 ms. MS3 quantification spectra were acquired with further HCD fragmentation of the top 10 most abundant CID fragments isolated with Synchronous Precursor Selection (SPS) excluding neutral losses of maximum m/z 30. Iontrap isolation width was set at 0.5 Th, collision energy was applied at 45% and the AGC setting was at 6x104 with 100 ms IT. The HCD MS3 spectra were acquired within 120-140 m/z with 60k resolution. Targeted precursors were dynamically excluded for further isolation and activation for 45 seconds with 7 ppm mass tolerance. Phosphopeptide samples were analyzed with top15 CID-HCD method at the MS2 level. MS level AGC was set at 6x105, IT was set at 150 ms and exclusion duration at 30sec. AGC settings for CID and HCD fragmentation were 5x104 and 2x105 respectively. The fractions for the replication and CRISPR/cas9 sets were analysed with 180 min and 300 min LC-MS runs respectively and the analysis was repeated by setting an upper intensity threshold at 2-5x106 to capture lower abundant peptides. The total data collection was accomplished with 469 LC-MS runs in about 1,000 hours of analysis.	The acquired mass spectra were submitted to SequestHT search in Proteome Discoverer 1.4 for protein identification and quantification. The precursor mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm and the fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 0.5 Da. Spectra were searched for fully tryptic peptides with maximum 2 miss-cleavages and minimum length of 6 amino acids. TMT6plex at N-termimus, K and Carbamidomethyl at C were defined as static modifications. Dynamic modifications included oxidation of M and Deamidation of N,Q. Maximum two different dynamic modifications were allowed for each peptide with maximum two repetitions each. Peptide confidence was estimated with the Percolator node. Peptide FDR was set at 0.01 and validation was based on q-value and decoy database search. All spectra were searched against a UniProt fasta file containing 20,165 reviewed human entries. The Reporter Ion Quantifier node included a custom TMT-10plex Quantification Method with integration window tolerance 15 ppm, integration method the Most Confident Centroid at the MS3 level and missing channels were replaced by minimum intensity. Only peptides uniquely belonging to protein groups were used for quantification. Peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) with mean TMT intensity less than 500 across samples were discarded. The TMT intensities of PSMs uniquely matching to the same protein were summed to obtain protein level intensities. Protein summed intensities were further corrected for equal loading across samples by median normalization (divide by column median). Scaled quantitative values in the range of 0 to 1,000 were obtained by dividing each TMT value with the mean TMT intensity across samples per protein in each multiplex set separately (divide by row mean x 100, per sample set).
