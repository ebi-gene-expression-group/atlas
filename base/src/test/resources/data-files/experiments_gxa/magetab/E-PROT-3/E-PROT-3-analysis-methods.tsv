Post-processing From the source data file, <a href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/download/normal_tissue.csv.zip">normal_tissue.csv</a>, first only data with Reliability = 'Supportive' were retained, and the four qualitative expression values: 'Not detected','Low','Medium' and 'High' were converted to values 0 to 3 respectively. Then, for each gene-tissue-cell type, a minimum expression value was chosen across all biological replicates. Finally, gene names were retrieved from Ensembl 83/GENCODE 24 (GRCh38).
