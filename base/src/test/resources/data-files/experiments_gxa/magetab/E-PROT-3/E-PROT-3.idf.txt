Investigation Title	Human immunochemistry data on 83 different normal cell types from 44 tissue types from the Human Protein Atlas project	
Comment[Submitted Name]	Human immunochemistry data on 83 different normal cell types from 44 tissue types from the Human Protein Atlas project	
Experiment Description	This experiment consists of expression profiles for proteins in human tissues based on immunohistochemistry tissue microarrays.  The tissue and cell samples came from 144 normal individuals.  Normal tissues are represented by samples from three individuals each (except for endometrium, skin, soft tissue and stomach which are represented by samples from six individuals each), one core per individual. <br> The data presented here is based on The Human Protein Atlas version 13 and Ensembl version 75.37.  This entry represents a top level summary of the metadata only.   For more information about the immunochemistry assays and how the tissue microarrays work for the assays, please visit the Human Protein Atlas website: http://www.proteinatlas.org/about/assays+annotation#ih

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-45692	
Protocol Type	data transformation	
Protocol Description	The data matrix was obtained from the Human Protein Atlas website for “normal tissue data”: http://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download . The exact download link is http://www.proteinatlas.org/download/normal_tissue.csv.zip. The downloaded comma-separated file includes Ensembl gene identifier (Gene), tissue name (Tissue), annotated cell type (Cell type), expression value (Level), the type of annotation (annotated protein expression (APE), based on more than one antibody, or staining, based on one antibody only) (Expression type), and the reliability or validation of the expression value (Reliability).  The qualitative expression value (in “levels”) is converted to a number scale from 1 to 4 (1 being the lowest and 4 the highest).
