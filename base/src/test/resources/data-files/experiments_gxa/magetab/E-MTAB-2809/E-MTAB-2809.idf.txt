Protocol Description	"(Adapted from section S6 of publication: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11543.) Each pool of libraries was clustered onto two lanes of an Illumina flowcell. Flow cells were clustered using TruSeq Paired-End Cluster Kit v3, following the Illumina PE_Amplification_Linearization_Blocking_Hybridisation_v8 recipe. On completion of the clustering procedure, the flow cell was loaded onto the Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument according to the manufacturers instructions. ( Illumina HiSeq2000 flow cell preparation: PE-401-3001: TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 - cBot - HS; GD-401-3001: TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3 - cBot - HS; FC-401-3001: TruSeq SBS Kit v3 - HS (200-cycles). http://www.illumina.com/technology/sequencing_technology.ilmn  ) A paired end sequencing protocol was performed generating 2 x 100bp reads using TruSeq SBS kit v3 sequencing chemistry, Illumina software HCS 1.4 and RTA 1.12."	"(Taken from section S6 of publication: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11543.)  All RNA-seq libraries were constructed and run at The Genome Analysis Centre (Norwich, UK). The Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample preparation kit (Illumina Inc.) was used according to the manufacturers protocol. In brief, poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified from 1 ug total RNA using poly-T oligo attached magnetic beads using two rounds of purification. The purified mRNA was fragmented by addition of 5x fragmentation buffer (Illumina, Hayward, CA) and was heated at 94 degrees C in a thermocycler for 8 minutes. The fragmentation yields fragments of ~250 bp. First strand cDNA was synthesised using random hexamers to eliminate the general bias towards 3' end of the transcript. Second strand cDNA synthesis was done by adding GEX second strand buffer (Illumina, Hayward, CA), dNTPs, RnaseH and DNA polymerase I followed by incubation for 2.5 h at 16 degrees C. Second strand cDNA was further subjected to end repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation with barcoded adapters in accordance with the manufacturer supplied protocols. Purified cDNA templates were enriched by 15 cycles of PCR for 10 s at 98 degrees C, 30 s at 60 degrees C, and 30 s at 72 degrees C using PCR Primer Mix Cocktail and PCR Master Mix (Illumina, Hayward, CA). The samples were cleaned using AMPure XP Beads and eluted in 30 ul Resuspension Buffer as per manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN, CA). Purified cDNA libraries were quantified using Bioanalyzer DNA 100 Chip (Agilent Technology 2100 Bioanalyzer). The libraries were normalised to 10 nM and pooled equimolarly in pools of 8 samples per pool. Each pool of libraries was diluted to 2nM with NaOH solution and 5 ?L of diluted library transferred into 995 ?L HT1 (high salt buffer supplied by Illumina) to give a final concentration of 10 pM. 120 ?L of normalised library was then transferred into a 200 ?L strip tube and placed on ice before loading onto the Illumina cBot cluster generation system. Each pool of libraries was clustered onto two lanes of an Illumina flowcell. Flow cells were clustered using TruSeq Paired-End Cluster Kit v3, following the Illumina PE_Amplification_Linearization_Blocking_Hybridisation_v8 recipe.  Please note that sample ERS155520 (Developing tillers at six leaf stage, 3rd internode) was not in any of the pooled libraries because of library failure; the library was prepared again at a later stage and run on its own. On completion of the clustering procedure, the flow cell was loaded onto the Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument according to the manufacturers instructions. A paired end sequencing protocol was performed generating 2 x 100bp reads using TruSeq SBS kit v3 sequencing chemistry, Illumina software HCS 1.4 and RTA 1.12."	"(Taken from section S6 of publication: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11543.) Tissue abbreviations: EMB (4-day embryo dissected from germinating grains), ROO (roots from the sedding, 10cm shoot stage), LEA (shoots from the seedlings, 10cm shoot stage), INF1 (young developing inflorescences, 5mm), INF2 (developing inflorescences, 1-1.5cm), NOD (developing tillers at six, leaf stage, 3rd internode), CAR5 (developing grain, bracts removed, 5 days post-anthesis), CAR15 (developing grain, bracts removed, 15- days post-anthesis). <br> Approximately 400 barley cv. Morex seeds were surface sterilized in 1% (v/v) bleach solution for 20 minutes, followed by extensive rinsing with tap water. Seeds were subdivided in three parts -one was used for germination on the plates to obtain EMB samples, the next was used to plant in the pots with perlite (for LEA and ROO samples), and the remaining in the pots with compost to grow plants for INF, NOD and CAR tissues. Tissue sampling was always performed between 10 and 11 am. All sampled tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and put in -80 degrees C freezer for RNA extraction. <br> In total, 8 barley tissues were prepared for RNA-seq as follows: <br>EMB: In total 20 sterilized seeds were spread across three stacked sheets of wet filter paper and covered with three sheets of wet filter paper in the large 23x23 cm square petri dishes. Petri dishes were wrapped in foil and placed in the same glasshouse area where seeds were planted. After four days of germination, embryonic tissue (coleoptile, mesocotyl and seminal roots) from nine similarly looking germinating seeds were dissected. <br> LEA, ROO: Sampling of the LEA and ROO tissue was made when upper parts of the plants grown in pots with perlite reached c. 10 cm length (17 days after planting). Plants were carefully removed from the pots, remains of the perlite were washed away, and roots and shoots were separated by cutting just below and above the root/shoot junction. Remains of the embryo were not sampled. Roots and shoots from four plants were used per sampling.<br> INF1, INF2: The main tillers of c. 30 day old plants were used to dissect developing inflorescences (INF1). Only those inflorescences that were about 5 mm long were collected for RNA extraction. In total, 15-20 inflorescences were dissected per sample. For obtaining 10-15 mm long inflorescences, main tillers from c. 50 day old plants were used. <br> NOD: The third internode (4-6 cm long) was dissected from 42 days old plants. Leaf blades and sheaths were removed, and the internode was cut out from just below the 4th and just above the 3rd nodes. <br> CAR5, CAR15: To obtain developing caryopses (CAR), anthesis time was determined using c. 60 day old plants by removing anthers from the central florets at the centre of the spike and examining their colour and determining whether they have shed. Spikes with yellow anthers, but not shedding, were marked and examined subsequently for shedding to set the anthesis time. Five days after anthesis, 3-5 mm long caryopses (CAR5) were dissected from the central florets of the central spike. Fifteen caryopses were collected per sample. Ten days later, c. 10 mm caryopses were dissected from spikes to obtain CAR15 samples."	"(Taken from section S6 of publication: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11543.) Total RNA was extracted from c. 200 mg dissected frozen tissue from each sample using 2 ml TriReagent (Sigma-Aldrich) as recommended, with two additional phenol-chloroform purification steps followed by ethanol precipitation. RNAs were quality checked using the RNA 6000 Nano kit on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). All RNA samples were judged high quality with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) >8."
