Filtering Step 1	Discard reads below minimum quality threshold
Filtering Step 2	Check of bacterial contamination; discard offending reads
Filtering Step 3	Discard reads with common uncalled characters (e.g. N)
Filtering Step 4	Remove reads from pair-end libraries that were orphaned by filtering steps 1-3
Read Mapping 	Against genome reference (Ensembl Ensemblgenomes.org/pub/DOTrelease-RELNO/plants/gtf/triticum_aestivum/Triticum_aestivum.IWGSC1.0+popseq.RELNO.gtf.gz release: 28) star version: 2.4.0i
Quantification	htseq2 version: 0.6.1p1
Normalized Counts per Gene	(FPKMs) are calculated from the raw counts by <a href="http://nunofonseca.github.io/irap/">iRAP</a>. These are averaged for each set of technical replicates, and then quantile normalized within each set of biological replicates using <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html">limma</a>. Finally, they are averaged for all biological replicates (if any)
