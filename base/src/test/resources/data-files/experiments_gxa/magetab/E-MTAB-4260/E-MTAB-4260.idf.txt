Comment[Submitted Name]	Characterization of development wheat grain in morphological stage by RNA-seq	
Experiment Description	Wheat yield is correlated significantly with grain size which is established during morphological stage. In present study, morphological stage of developing wheat grain were analyzed by RNA-seq.This research will help us to understand the mechnism underlying of grain development. This is the first study on gene expression profiling of morphological stage of developing wheat grain and the results may aid the identification of pathways and genes associated with seed development in wheat.
