Investigation Title	Differentially expressed genes associated with hepatic steatosis in zebrafish						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Differentially expressed genes associated with hepatic steatosis in zebrafish						
Experiment Description	Expression microarray of livers from adult zebrafish: control, overfed, and ahcy+/- Comparison of expression from livers obtained from ahcy+/+, overfed ahcy+/+, ahcy+/- control and ahcy+/- overfed. Adult zebrafish, ahcy+/+ and +/-, were given a regular diet or were overfed for a month. Livers were removed, RNA isolated, and expression microarray was performed.

Protocol Name	P-GSE48806-1	P-GSE48806-5	P-GSE48806-6	P-GSE48806-2	P-GSE48806-3	P-GSE48806-4	P-GSE48806-7
Protocol Description	Probe-level data in CEL files was normalized using GCRMA method implemented in Partek Genomics Suite to get gene-level expression measurements ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized, log2-transformed intensity measurements	RNA was labeled with Cy3 in accordance with Affymetrix standard protocol	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA was hybridized for 16 hr at 45 °C on GeneChip Zebrafish Genome arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fludics Station 450	One tank of ahcy+/+ and +/- adults fed the typical amount, one tank given excess food ad lib	Adult zebrafish were maintained at 28 °C in water as per standard practice	After a month, animals were sacrificed and livers were removed and then placed into RNAlater	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000, 7G
Protocol Type	normalization data transformation protocol	labelling protocol	hybridization protocol	sample treatment protocol	growth protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	array scanning protocol
