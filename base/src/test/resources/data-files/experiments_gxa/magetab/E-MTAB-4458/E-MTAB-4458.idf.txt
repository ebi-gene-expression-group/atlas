Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Assessment of low-dose bisphenol A (BPA) toxicity in rat thyroid follicular cells by gene expression microarray				
Investigation Title	Assessment of low-dose BPA toxicity in thyroid follicular cells by gene expression microarray.				
Comment[Submitted Name]	Assessment of low-dose BPA toxicity in thyroid follicular cells by gene expression microarray.
Experiment Description	Gene expression microarrays were performed to investigate the molecular effects of exposure to BPA on thyrocytes (FRTL-5). Cells were treated with low-lose BPA (10^-9 M) at different time points to analyse time dependent toxicity.

Protocol Description	RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturerâs protocols	cRNA was generated by using the Affymetrix One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagent kit (AffymetrixInc), following the manufacturerâs protocol, starting from 5 Î¼g of total RNA	Biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to the Mouse MOE430 2.0 Genome Arrays (Affymetrix)	Chips were washed and scanned on the Affymetrix Complete GeneChip System, generating digitized image data files	Rat thyroid follicular cells FRTL-5 were maintained in Coonâs modified F12 medium (EuroClone) supplemented with 5% newborn bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories) and six hormones (6H), including TSH, 1 mU/ml (SigmaâAldrich), and insulin, 10 Î¼g/ml (SigmaâAldrich), as previously described (6H medium) [25]. All the treatments were performed using a concentration of BPA 10^-9M.
