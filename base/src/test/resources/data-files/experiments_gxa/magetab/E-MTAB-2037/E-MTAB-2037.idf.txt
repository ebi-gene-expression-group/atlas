Comment[Submitted Name]	Retrogenes in rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) exhibit correlated expression with their source genes.
Experiment Description	Expression in seven tissues from Oryza sativa L. ssp japonica Nipponbare was profiled using RNA-sequencing: callus, leaf, root, seed, shoot, panicle before flowering, and panicle after flowering. The original experiment examined gene expression in the seven tissues, and utilized the data both to compare gene expression patterns between retrogenes and their parents and to compare patterns of expression divergence between RNA-based duplicates and DNA-based duplicates Note: All samples in SRA were assigned the same sample accession (DRS000668). This is incorrect as there are different samples, hence “Source Name” was replaced with new values. Comment[ENA_SAMPLE] contains the original SRA sample accessions.

Protocol Description	We obtained seeds (accession number ‘‘JP229579’’) from the GENE bank in the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Japan (http://www.gene.affrc.go.jp/about_en.php). The seeds were germinated in a growth chamber at 28degreesC under a 16-h light/8-h dark regime. Seven days after germination, shoots and roots were collected. In the meantime, plants were grown in paddy fields, where leaves (7 days before heading to 7 days after flowering) and panicles (7 days before and 0–7 days after heading to flowering) were collected. Callus was induced on N6D medium according to a previous protocol (Ozawa 2009).	For RNA extraction from each plant tissue, at least 10 plants were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and mixed, to minimize the effect of transcriptome unevenness among plants. Total RNA was extracted from each tissue with the RNeasy Plantmini kit (Qiagen).	cDNA was synthesized with mRNAseq 8-sample prep kit (Illumina) (Mizuno et al. 2010). We constructed cDNA libraries for the seven tissues individually.	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. We sequenced single ends of each library on the Illumina GAIIx platform for four separate runs (three at 36 cycles and one at 76 cycles).
