Investigation Title	Nitrogen-efficient rice over-expressing alanine aminotransferase at three different N concentrations						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Nitrogen-efficient rice over-expressing alanine aminotransferase at three different N concentrations						
Experiment Description	Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare was engineered to over-express a barley alanine aminotransferase (alaAT) gene using the promoter (OsANT1) from a rice aldehyde dehydrogenase gene that expresses in roots. We use biotechnology to improve the nitrogen use efficiency of rice by over-expressing alaAT in a tissue specific (root) manner. The AlaAT enzyme is a reversible aminotransferase that is linked to both C and N metabolism since it uses pyruvate plus glutamate to produce alanine and 2-oxoglutarate, and visa versa. Transcriptome data from the roots and shoots of rice plants at maximum tillering, grown hydroponically on either 0.5, 2 or 5 mM NH4+ as the nitrogen source. Wildtype rice (Nipponbare) and two independent OsANT1:HvAlaAT rice transgenic lines (AGR1/7, and AGR3/8) were grown hydroponically with either 0.5, 2 or 5mM NH4+ as the nitrogen source, to the reproductive stage. Tissue samples were taken at active and maximum tillering from root and shoot, at mid-day of the plants' day/night cycle. The RNA from root and shoot at maxiumum tillering was used for mcroarray analysis. Please read Beatty et al., 2009, PLant Biotechnology Journal 7, pp562-576 for detailed about these transgenic lines. The results from this variable N study were reported in a manuscript submitted to Botany, July 2013

Protocol Description	dCHIP was used to normalize and model the data. The raw microarray signals were normailized using the invarient set normailization method. The model-based expression values were calculated using the fifth percentile, perfect match only model with outlier detection. ID_REF =  VALUE = dCHIP Signal intensity expression values for each replicate CALL =  SE = 	All biologically replicated RNA samples were labelled and hybridized in parallel using the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Syngenta Biotechnology).	All biologically replicated RNA samples were labelled and hybridized in parallel using the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Syngenta Biotechnology).	Tissue samples were taken, weighed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen until groundwith liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle and the RNA extracted.	Either 0.5, 2 or 5mM NH4+ as the nitrogen source, hydroponic growth, 28 degrees C, 70% relative humidity, 14 hr day length/10 hr night length, light intensity 750 uE.	Total RNA was extracted using the TRI reagent protocol according to manufacturers instructions (Applied Biosystems). RNA samples were cleaned of phenol contamination using Rneasy plant mini kit	cDNA target synthesis quality was assessed by examination of the 3' and 5' probesets of the reference gene controls on the Affymetrix genechip and scanned using GCOS software.
