Investigation Title	RNA-seq analysis of 5 cell line models for haematopoiesis in Project - Epigenomes of Cell Lines						
Comment[Submitted Name]	RNA-seq analysis of 5 cell lines in Project 1 of  CTTV020 - Epigenomes of Cell Lines						
Experiment Description	This experiment captures the baseline expression of 5 cell lines (K562, KU812, MEG01, HEL9217, F36-P) selected for Project 1, Open Targets (formerly CTTV020). These cell lines are all possible cell line models for haematopoiesis.<br>These RNAseq experiments are carried out as part of the Open Targets (formerly CTTV020) project to identify a gene expression signature of common immortalised cell lines / models. This signature / fingerprint will be used in combination with data from ChIPseq experiments from the same cell types to compare various human immortalised cell models against primary cells and tissues. The overall aims of the Open Targets (formerly CTTV020) Cell Line Epigenome project are to establish a systematic approach for the determination of human biological & disease relevance through the generation of transciptomic and epigenomic data in cell types of interest. Integration of cell type mRNA expression and epigenome data with existing & newly generated reference data from human tissue and cell types to identify assay systems which will provide greater confidence in translating target biology and compound pharmacology to patients. To provide a framework for the identification of optimal cell types for target identification/validation studies and drug discovery programs across multiple therapeutic areas. Development of bioinformatics pipelines and Open Targets components for analysis and provision of data.

Protocol Description	RPMI1640 10% HiFBS 1% L-glut	RPMI1640 10% FBS	RPMI1640 10% FBS 1% Glutamax 1% sodium pyruvate	RPMI1640 10% FBS 1% Glutamax 1% sodium pyruvate 10ng/ml rhGM-CSF	Qiagen RNeasy plus mini kit	Total RNA from each sample was used as input for the Illumina TruSeq Stranded messenger RNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequencing libraries were created according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Briefly, poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA was fragmented and copied into first strand complementary DNA using random primers and reverse transcriptase. Second strand cDNA synthesis was then done using DNA polymerase I, RNase H and substituting dUTP for dTTP. The cDNA was ligated to adapters and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA library. The library was pooled and sequenced 	Paired end sequencing at 75bp
