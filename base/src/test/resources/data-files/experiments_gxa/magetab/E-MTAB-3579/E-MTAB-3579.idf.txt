Comment[Submitted Name]	RNA-Seq CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) analysis of mice tissue in RIKEN FANTOM5 project
Experiment Description	This experiment captures the expression data reported by the RIKEN FANTOM5 project ( http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/ ), focusing on mice tissue data which was deposited in the sequence read archive (SRA) under study accession DRP001032 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/DRP001031 ) .  The samples in this experiment can also be found on a dedicated page of the FANTOM website: http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/sstar/Browse_samples. Since this is CAGE analysis, gene expression data is reported by FANTOM5 in TPMs (tags per milliion) for gene promoters. This is in conjunction with  E-MTAB-3578 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3578/)
