Comment[Submitted Name]	Ecotype specific nitrogen responses in the Arabidopsis root																																															
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of whole roots from seven Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes with nitrogen treatment against untreated controls																																															
Experiment Description	"Root branching in response to changes in nitrogen status in the soil, is a dramatic example of the plantâ€™s remarkable developmental plasticity.  In recent work we investigated the genetic architecture of developmental plasticity, combining phenoclustering and genome-wide association studies in 96 Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes with expression profiling in 7 ecotypes, to characterise natural variation in root architectural plasticity at the phenotypic, genetic, and transcriptional levels. This series contains the microarray expression data for 7 ecotypes that represent a range of root branching strategies. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression involved in the plants response to nitrogen in the root and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes in the seven different Arabidopsis ecotypes during this process. The whole experiment was carried out in triplicate with 42 chips in total (14 experiments).  The nitrogen response in seven Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype (Col0, Kas2, NFA8, SQ8, TAMM27, Ts5, Var2-1) whole roots was assayed using Affymetrix microarrays.  Seedlings were grown hydroponically in low nitrogen for 12 days, then 5mM KNO3 was used as a nitrogen treatment for 2 hours with 5mM KCl used as a control treatment for the same length of time.  At the end of the treatment time roots were harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction.

Protocol Description	"The data were analyzed with MAS5.0 as normal for Col0 data but with a modification to the normalisation method to enable a subset of probe sequences within each probe set to be excluded for non-Col0 data.  Probe sequences (within probe sets for each gene) whose signal values were not used were those predicted using our bioinformatic analysis not to hybridise non-Col0 RNA on the Col0 Affymetrix microarray due to sequence differences in the non-Col0 ecotypes; these were excluded to give a more accurate signal value for each gene in the non-Col0 ecotypes.  The probe sequences to be excluded were identified per experiment (i.e. an experiment consisted of the three replicate samples, e.g. Kas2 control, or Kas2 treat). Lists of probe sequences within each gene probeset that were not used for normalisation are supplied in text files (one per experiment) together with a key that denotes the probe numbers given in the experiment files to the Affymetrix probe IDs. On average, 10% of all probe sets were analysed with the complete set of 11 elements and a further 70% analysed with 9 or 10 elements. For example, in Kas2C_Probe_Elements_Removed, the first row is 4,1.  4,1 refers to probe number '4'.  The key for which probe number '4' is, is in the 'key' file and it corresponds to the probe name given on row 4. The same key file is used to interpret all of the other files.  The '1' means that the first element of this probeset was excluded from analysis.  The data was analysed within replicate sets, so for replicates 1, 2, and 3 of Kas2 C the same elements were removed. The reasoning for this is that we used all replicates to identify with best accuracy which elements were not hybridising normally.

GeneChips were washed and stained using the 'EukGE-WS2v4_450' protocol in the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450."	At dawn on 12th day plants were either nitrogen-treated (KNO3 to 5mM added) or KCl treated (KCl to 5mM added) as a control treatment for 2 hrs. Whole roots were then harvested and frozen using liquid nitrogen.	Plants were grown for 12 days in long day (16hr light/8hr dark) 22 oC conditions in a Percival (Percival Scientific). Plants were grown hydroponically in basal MS containing no nitrogen except 0.5mM ammonium succinate and 3mM sucrose.	"Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions."	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 Scanner according to standard Affymetrix protocols.
