Investigation Title	RNA-seq of coding RNA from two inbred strains of maize, B73 and Mo17																													
Comment[Submitted Name]	RNA-seq of coding RNA from two inbred strains of maize, B73 and Mo17
Experiment Description	This is a total RNA-seq data set of two inbred strains of maize, B73 and Mo17, extracted from experiment E-GEOD-39232 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEOD-39232/). E-GEOD-39232 is a larger study which also studied the expression of small RNAs and genome-wide cytosine methylation pattern in the two strains using high-throughput sequencing methods.  For total RNA-seq, three biological replicates were used per strain.  E-GEOD-39232 was originally submitted to NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE39232 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39232) and later imported to ArrayExpress as E-GEOD-39232.

Protocol Name	P-GSE39232-3	P-GSE39232-2	P-GSE39232-1
Protocol Description	Base call and quality scores were generated using the standard Illumina Pipeline. BS-seq reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence and low quality base call, then aligned to ZmB73 4a.53 genome assembly using rmap V2.03 with parameters -Q -v -m 4 Then the C/T counts from aligned BS-seq reads for each cytosine in reference genome were saved in CT count file RNA-seq reads were aligned to ZmB73 4a.53 and calculated FPKM using Tophat v1.3.2/Cufflinks v1.1.0 smRNA-seq reads were aligned to ZmB73 4a.53 genome aeembly using rmap V2.03 with parameters -Q -v -m 2, then the mapped 21/22/24 nt smRNA-seq reads were counted in each 1M bin in whole genome Genome_build: ZmB73 4a.53 Please note that the bed files for B73 DNA rep 1,2,3 and M017 DNA rep 1,2,3,4 Samples are on the Series record. Supplementary_files_format_and_content: The CT count files have the first 6 columns the same as bed file, the 7th col is count of C, the 8th col is count of T, the 9th col is the 3 nt in reference genome, the 10th col is the context of cytosine Supplementary_files_format_and_content: The FPKM tracking file format is described in http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/manual.html Supplementary_files_format_and_content: The BED from smRNA-seq data contains the count of mapped smRNA-seq reads in each 1M bin in the whole genome	Total RNA was prepared by grinding tissue in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen 15596-026) on dry ice and processed following the protocol provided by manufacturer. To remove DNA, an aliquot of total RNA was treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega M6101), followed by phenol/chloroform/ iso-amyl alcohol extraction, chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA (20 Î¼g) was used for poly(A)+ selection using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen 610-02), eluted in water and used for RNA-seq library construction with ScriptSeqTM kit (Epicentre SS10906) or mRNA-seq Sample Prep kit (Illumina RS-100-0801) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. DNA concentrations were quantified on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent), diluted to 10 nM and loaded on flow cells to generate clusters. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina GAII or HiSeq2000 machines using the paired-end 50 cycle protocol.	Seeds were grown in the incubator at 25°C in darkness on wet paper towels set in glass Pyrex dish. After 5 days coleoptiles were excised and stored at -80°C.
