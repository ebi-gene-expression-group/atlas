Experiment Description	We wanted to study regulation of gene regulation by sba1 (ortholog of mammalian p23) in yeast. sba1/p23 binds to Hsp90 and acts as a co-chaperone. We have a small molecule, radicicol, an analog of geldanamycin to inhibit the binding of p23 to Hsp90. Consequently, we have analyzed the gene expression profile in 4 conditions, wt, delta-sba1; and when Hsp90 function is impaired, that is, wt and delta-sba1 treated with radicicol.
