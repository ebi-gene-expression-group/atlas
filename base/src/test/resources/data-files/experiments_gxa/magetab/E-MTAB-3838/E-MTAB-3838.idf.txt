Investigation Title	Sheep Tissue Atlas		
Comment[Submitted Name]	Sheep Tissue Atlas
Experiment Description	Sheep total RNA was extracted from embryonic and adult tissues. Sequencing libraries were prepared from the RNA using the Illumina TruSeq stranded total RNA with the Ribo Zero gold option for the rRNA removal. The fragmentation in the standard protocol was modified to increase the average insert size in the library. Sequencing with 151 base paired end reads was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in rapid mode.
