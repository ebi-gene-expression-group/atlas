Investigation Title	Expression data from skin of bovines infested with ticks							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from skin of bovines infested with ticks							
Experiment Description	The aim of this work was to access the early immune response triggered by R. microplus larvae attachment in previously selected resistant and susceptible animals in a bovine F2 population derived from Gyr (Bos indicus) x Holstein (Bos taurus) crosses. We used microarray data both to access the changes in gene expression over the course of the first 48 hours after tick infestation as constrasting the phenotypically diferent groups. From a bovine F2 population, six tick-resistant (R) and seven tick-susceptible (S) animals were used in this experiment.  Skin biopses were taken at the feeding sites before infestation (0 hour), 24 and 48 hours after tick infestation in each animal.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 MAS5.0 signal intensity	3' IVT Express kit (Affymetrix) was used to the amplification and labeling from 50 ng of total RNA.	About 12.5ug of purified and fragmented aRNA were hybridized in Genechip Bovine Genome Array (Affymetrix) using GeneChip Hybridization Oven.	Skin biopsies were kept in RNAlater (Ambion) until the RNA extraction.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After, the total RNA was purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacterer's instructions.	After washed in GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 according to the manufactere's instructions, the GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
