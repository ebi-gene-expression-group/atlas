Experiment Description	Global gene expression analysis of grapevine cv. Pinot Noir berries during development and ripening. Time-course comparison of samples collected at three developmental stages (stages 33, 34 and 36 according to the modified E-L system, ref: Coombe BG, Aust J Grape Wine Res 1995, 1: 104-110) during three seasons (2003, 2005 and 2006).

Protocol Description	Ten Vitis vinifera cv Pinot Noir clusters were collected for each time-point from the vineyard under study  during three growing seasons (2003, 2005 and 2006). Fifty berries were randomly detached, pooled and immediately frozen. Three sub-pools of 8 frozen berries each were then randomly generated and used for three independent RNA extractions, that were regarded as biological replicates of that time point.	Total RNA was isolated from frozen deseeded berries without petiole using the hot borate method (Moser et al, Molecular Biotechnology 26; 95-99; 2004) and further purified using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality and quantity were assessed by gel-electrophoresis and by UV-absorption spectrophotometry.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Data of each year were normalized separately and expressed as log2-value using the GeneChip Robust Multi-Array Analysis (GCRMA) algorithm, implemented in the "GCRMA" R package  (http://www.bioconductor.org/repository/devel/vignette/gcrma.pdf).
