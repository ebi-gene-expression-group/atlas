<div id="geneSearch">Enter Ensembl gene ID(s) or gene symbol(s) to search with genes of interest. Separate them
    with new lines or spaces. Leave blank to search all annotated
    genes in this data set.
</div>

<div id="factorSearch">Select tissue(s) to see gene expression profiles for. Leave blank to see expressions in all of
    them.
</div>

<div id="cutoff">Enter a <b>minimum expression level</b> (FPKM) cut-off. Only genes with expression
    above this level will be displayed. The default cut-off is 0.5; if you would like to
    see results for the entire data set, change this to 0.
    FPKM stands for "fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads", and
    is a normalized measure of expression used in RNA-sequencing analysis.
</div>

<div id="gene-distribution">The histogram shows the number of genes (y-axis) expressed above expression
    level cutoffs (x-axis) for the chosen tissues. You can use it to help you choose a minimum cut-off. Click on a
    bar to select its expression level as the minimum cut-off.
</div>

<div id="toggleHistogramButton">Click this button to toggle display of the histogram showing the distribution of
    expression
    levels.
</div>

<div id="slider">Choose a minimum expression level (FPKM) cut-off using the slider. Only genes with
    expression above this level will be displayed
</div>

<!--experiment -->
<div id="gradient">The colour gradient represents relative expression level: the more saturated the colour, the
    higher the expression level is.
</div>

<div id="anatomogram">Tissues studied in this data set are displayed on the figure. Mouseover a gene in the table
    to highlight the tissue(s) in which it is expressed above the selected minimum expression level. Mouseover tissues
    in the table to highlight them on the figure.
</div>

<div id="heatmapTable">How are the results sorted?
Genes are sorted in order of expression level, from highest to lowest.
* If you did not select any tissues, results are ordered so that genes with expression above the
chosen cut-off in any one tissue are shown first (with highest expression level first), and then genes
with expression above the cutoff in any two tissues, and so on.
* If you selected a set of tissues, results are ordered so that genes with expression above the chosen
cut-off in all your chosen tissues are shown first (with highest expression level first), followed by
genes with expression above the cut-off in all but one of your chosen tissues, followed by genes with
expression in all but two of your tissues, and so on.</div>

<div id="resultInfo">Only the top 50 genes are displayed on this page; please download your results to see them
    all.</div>

<div id="heatMapTableCellInfo">A coloured box indicates the gene is expressed in the
corresponding tissue(s). The colour saturation of the box
indicates the expression level. To see the exact expression level
(FPKM), click on the box, or click the "Display levels" button in
the top-left of the table to see them all. Expression levels greater
than or equal to 1 are rounded to the nearest whole value.
Expression levels less than 1 are rounded to 1 decimal place.</div>
