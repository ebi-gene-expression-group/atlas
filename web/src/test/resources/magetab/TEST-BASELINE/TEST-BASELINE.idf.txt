Protocol Description	"1ug of total RNA was subjected to two rounds of  oligo-dT beads binding. Purified mRNA was fragmented and random primed for cDNA synthesis. cDNA fragements were end repared, added dATP, and liagted to illumina pair end sample prep adaptor. The ligated material was amplified by PCR for 15 cycles, and used for illumina sequencing."	"1ug of total RNA was subjected to two rounds of oligo-dT beads binding. The purified RNA was fragmentated, end repared and ligated with illumina small RNA v1.5 adaptors. The ligated RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR amplified with 15 cycles, and used for illumina sequencing."	Final product from mRNA-stranded protocol was normalized by DSN digestion and used for sequencing.	"100ng of total RNA was fragmentated, end repared and ligated with illumina small RNA v1.5 adaptors. The ligated RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR amplified with 15 cycles. The PCR product was normalized by DSN digestion and used for sequencing."	Illumina sequencing was performed at HiSeq 2000 at Illumina	FASTQ files (Illumina format) of sequencing reads were retrieved from the sequencing machine
