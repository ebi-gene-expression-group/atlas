Comment[Submitted Name]	Papio anubis Transcriptome or Gene expression
Experiment Description	This data set consists of tissue-specific RNA-seq reads from 14 different tissues from a single female adult olive baboon (Papio anubis): bone marrow, brain cerebellum, brain frontal cortex, brain pituitary, brain temporal lobe, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lymph node, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle and thymus. The data set was generated by the non-human primate reference transcriptome resource (NHPRTR) project (http://nhprtr.org/), and was first made public on 14 Jan 2014.

Protocol Description	Illumina HiSeq 2000 software. Illumina HiSeq2000 flow cell preparation: PE-401-3001: TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 - cBot - HS; GD-401-3001: TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3 - cBot - HS; FC-401-3001: TruSeq SBS Kit v3 - HS (200-cycles). http://www.illumina.com/technology/sequencing_technology.ilmn	Adapted from http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/D1/D906.full :The library preparations were done using established Illumina methods for mRNA-Seq (Part #RS-100-0801). Briefly, poly A+ RNA is purified from 100 ng of total RNA with oligo-dT beads. Purified mRNA is then fragmented with divalent cations at elevated temperature. First strand cDNA synthesis is performed with random hexamer priming and reverse transcriptase. Second strand cDNA synthesis is performed using RNAseH and DNA PolI. Following cDNA synthesis, the double stranded products are end repaired, followed by addition of a single ÔAÕ base and then ligation of the Illumina PE adaptors. For this study, the ligation products were purified using gel electrophoresis. The target size range for these libraries was ?250 bp on the gel such that the final library for sequencing would have cDNA inserts with sizes of ?150 bp long. Following gel purification the adapter ligated cDNA is then amplified with 15 cycles of PCR. This initial library was then subject to DSN normalization and additional rounds of PCR as described below for the Total RNA-Seq protocol. 	Taken from Adapted from http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/D1/D906.full: Isolated RNA was characterized by absorbance spectroscopy to ensure the absence of contamination by protein or phenol and then analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to furnish an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) using an Agilent Bioanalyzer¨. RNA concentrations for individual tissue RNA samples were based on integrated fluorescence intensity in the Bioanalyzer runs, calibrated against an RNA standard	Tissues from one female olive baboon were collected via the Washington National Primate Research Center Tissue Distribution Program. All frozen samples were shipped to the University of Washington and the RNA isolated under a standard protocol using TRIzol extraction and purification with RNeasy¨ columns (QIAGEN).
