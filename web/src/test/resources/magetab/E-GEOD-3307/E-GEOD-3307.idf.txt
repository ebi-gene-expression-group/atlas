Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of 12 human muscle diseases
Experiment Description	Summary:   Genetic disorders of muscle cause muscular dystrophy, and are some of the most common inborn errors of metabolism. Muscle also rapidly remodels in response to training and innervation. Muscle weakness and wasting is important in such conditions as aging, critical care medicine, space flight, and diabetes. Finally, muscle can also be used to investigate systemic defects, and the compensatory mechansisms invoked by cells to overcome biochemical and genetic abnormalities. Here, we provide a 13 group data set for comparative profiling of human skeletal muscle. Groups studied are: Normal human skeletal muscle, Acute quadriplegic myopathy (AQM; critical care myopathy), Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), Amyotophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spastic paraplegia (SPG4; spastin), Fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (both X linked recessive emerin form; autosomal dominant Lamin A/C form), Becker muscular dystrophy (partial loss of dystrophin), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (complete loss of dystrophin), Calpain 3 (LGMD2A), dysferlin (LGMD2B), FKRP (glycosylation defect; homozygous for a missense mutation). U133A and U133B microarrays are both available. Hypothesis:   This data set is able to define biochemical pathways that are either specific for a disease group, or shared between disease groups. For example, this data set has been used to determine the biochemical pathway perturbations that are shared between the two different types of Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (lamin A/C, and emerin).  Specific Aim:   The specific aim of this study is to determine the disease-specific transcriptional profiles of these 13 patient groups, and to determine if these expression fingerprints provide either pathophysiology or diagnostic information for these diseases. Some of the groups in this large data set have been reported previously using U95A microarrays, as follows:   Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM): Tezak Z, Hoffman EP, Lutz JL, Fedczyna TO, Stephan D, Bremer EG, Krasnoselska-Riz I, Kumar A, Pachman LM.
