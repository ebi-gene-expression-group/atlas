Investigation Title	Caco-2 cells: cultured in conventional vs apical anaerobic conditions
Comment[Submitted Name]	Caco-2 cells: cultured in conventional vs apical anaerobic conditions
Experiment Description	Transcriptional profiling of Caco-2 cells comparing Caco-2 monolayers cultured in a custom built co-culture chamber, either inside a 5% COâ incubator (conventional cell culture environment) or an anaerobic workstation (apical anaerobic environment) for 12 hours. Two-condition experiment with dye swap, A vs B, 6 biological replicates

Protocol Name	P-GSE43049-2	P-GSE43049-1	P-GSE43049-7	P-GSE43049-4	P-GSE43049-9	P-GSE43049-8	P-GSE43049-3	P-GSE43049-5	P-GSE43049-6
Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5)	ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (Cy5/Cy3)	The labelled samples were hybridized onto Agilent Technologies 44k whole human genome oligonucleotide arrays (G4112A) according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis (Quick Amp Labeling), Version 5.7, March 2008, Agilent Technologies).	Caco-2 cells were cultured in Transwell inserts in Medium 199 (M199; Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids (MEM nonessential amino acids 100x solution; Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U penicillin G sodium salt and 10,000 mg streptomycin sulphate in 0.85% (v/v) saline; GIBCO) at 37ï¿½C in 5% COâ.	Microarrays scanned using Agilent Microarray Scanner G2565CA. Data processed using limma package in R 2.14.2. No background correction, Loess within array normalisation and Aquantile between array normalisation.	The microarray slides were scanned using a DNA Microarray Scanner G2565CA (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.	After 14 days the inserts were transfered to one of two custom built co-culture chambers either placed in a 5 % COâ incubator (control, conventional conditions) or an anaerobic workstation for 12 hours. Caco-2 cell in the anaerobic workstation were exposed to an anaerobic environement (10% COâ, 10% Hâ in Nâ) on the apical side, while recieving oxygen from the basal side (apical anaerobic conditions).	RNAprotect Cell Reagent (Qiagen) was added at a volume of approximately nine times the volume of the apical media to lyse the Caco-2 cells and stabilize the RNA. Total RNA was extracted from the Caco-2 cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturerâs protocol.	The RNA samples were amplified and labeled with either cyanine-3 or cyanine-5 labeled CTP dye using the Agilent Quick-Amp Labeling Kit (5190-0424) as per the manufacturer's instructions (Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis (Quick Amp Labeling), Version 5.7, March 2008, Agilent Technologies).
