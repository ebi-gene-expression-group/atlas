Experiment Description	12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and phytoprostane A1 (PPA1) are cyclopentenone oxylipins that are formed via the enzymatic; jasmonate pathway and a nonenzymatic, free radicalÃ¢ÂÂcatalyzed pathway, respectively. Both types of cyclopentenone oxylipins; induce the expression of genes related to detoxification, stress responses, and secondary metabolism, a profile clearly distinct; from that of the cyclopentanone jasmonic acid. To investigate the role of TGA transcriction factors in oxylipin responses, the regulation of gene expression by OPDA and PPA1 defective in; the expression of TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6 was analyzed using; Affymetrix ATH1 chips. Experiment Overall Design: 18 hybs total
